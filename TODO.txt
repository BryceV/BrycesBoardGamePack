1) Settings
	-Enforce turn timer
	-Change board size
	-Change game mode (normal mode, hard mode, more themed modes, random words fetched from dictionary api, etc)
2) Party lobbies (think jackbox games)
	-You can chose your team color from here/maybe a team name and player name
3) Win/loss counter just for that game session
4) Game score boards (Maybe wins for team with "name". Like an arcade score board)
5) Fun audio sounds for winning/losing, increase clapping sound for a series of correct words
6) More game types: did you know, scattegories
7) Look into web transport instead of sockets
