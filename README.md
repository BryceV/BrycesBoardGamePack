# Bryce's Board Game Pack 

This is my take on many popular board games. Currently implemented: "Codenames" and a custom game type called "Did You Know" (similar to two truths and a lie)

### Where can I play
* Deployed site on [render](https://brycesboardgamepack.onrender.com/)

### Development
Build the web apps in each FE directory with `npm run build` and serve from root with `npm run dev`

Additionally you can start in the web app (usually :3000/\<app name\>/\<room code\>) and run the FE side with `npm run start` and server with `npm run dev` for live FE reloading 

### Future work
See a feature or found a bug? Feel free to make suggestions or (better yet) contribution to the project for future iterations (Need an inspiration? Review my TODO file)!
